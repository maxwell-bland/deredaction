This is a collection of scripts created by Timothy B. Lee while he was a grad student at Princeton University
in 2010-11. The code is released into the public domain, as described in the COPYING file.

Like most software, it's woefully under-documented. Improving the documentation is on my to-do list.

Thanks to Carl Malamud and Public.Resource.org for their support of my work.
